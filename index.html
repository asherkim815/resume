          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I am confident I will be valuable to your company for three reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span>I have history of great teamwork</span>
              <p>
                All teams I belonged to achieved great results. My team won new
                employee product idea competition at CJ CheilJedang, collegiate
                baseball club won 2nd place in national tournament, collegiate
                classical guitar club won 1st place in national competition, and
                more. By putting team above me and doing what team needs, even
                if I don't like it, I believe I contributed to each team's
                success.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>I tailor my work to customer and employer</span>
              <p>
                I ran e-commerce business for two years, and though I failed, I
                experienced being business owner. I will work from customer's
                and employer's perspectives, not mine.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>I will grow quickly as developer</span>
              <p>
                It's likely I will make performing developer for two reasons.
                First, I fit programming. I enjoy spending time thinking and
                solving difficult problems. At school, people sought me for one
                reason: math problems. Second, I learn fast. One of my Gallup
                strengths is Input: gathering and soaking in new information. I
                will learn what you require (e.g. tech stacks) and adapt to work
                environment swiftly.

          </ol>

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <div class="flex-space-between">
            <div>
              <p><span>Overseas Sales Representative</span></p>
              <p>
                North America Team, Overseas Sales Department, CJ CheilJedang

            </div>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Managed key food products' export to North America, and helped NA
              team exceed goal by 5-20% every quarter
            </li>
            <li>
              Elicited good cooperation from involved departments (Marketing,
              Packaging, Quality, SCM, Production, and more) by always
              communicating with humility, rare behavior in company's
              competitive culture
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased involved departments' performances by voluntarily
              devising and doing needed work. Organized weekly spreadsheets
              containing key products' orders, inventory, and production dates.
              Shared with SCM and Production, helped them make effective
              schedule adjustments, and prevented almost 100% of stockouts. Had
              more personal workload but decreased others' (e.g. stopped feuds
              and negotiations among Overseas Sales teams that arose from
              stockouts).
